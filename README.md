# How much time you’ve spent watching TV shows

## Demo: <a href="https://tiii.me">https://tiii.me</a>

A small web app that calculates how much time you’ve spent watching TV shows. Autocomplete plugin by [Igor Vaynberg](https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2).

## Forking / Using the project yourself
If you’re gonna use this project, please change the API key in the JavaScript file to your own API key from https://www.themoviedb.org. 

The exact file you need to change with your own API key is [/scripts/partials/tv_show.js](https://github.com/alexcican/tiii.me/blob/gh-pages/scripts/partials/_tv-show.js#L33), line #33, but you’ll also want to compile a new minified app.min.js file (that’s the JS file that gets referenced in [the HTML, line 101](https://github.com/alexcican/tiii.me/blob/gh-pages/index.html#L101)) and replace the old one.
